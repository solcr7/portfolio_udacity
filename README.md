Portfolio - Project No. 1 for the Frontend Nanodegree at Udacity

## Required Elements
* at least 4 images
* title text (h1, h2, etc.)
* regular (paragraph)text
* a logo

Aditionally we should:
* Provide at least one customization
* All content is responsive and displays on all display sizes
* Code quality should follow basic formatting rules
* The final code should be validated

## My Result
I started with the very simple design-mockup I was provided with, but quite soon decided, that I wanted to do a little bit more than that. Since this page is my first "real" web-project, I couldn't showcase any pages I had done in the past. So instead I put in placeholder-images and -paragraphs to showcase life-projects that I have in mind for next year. 
I will replace them with links to my upcoming udacity-projects. 
I also added a CV, just because the page looked too small otherwise...
And once I had finished the basic project and I still had some time left, I started to add detail after detail, so that in the end my project looks nothing like the mock-up anymore...but hopefully still has all the required elements.

I validaded my code (HTML and CSS)
